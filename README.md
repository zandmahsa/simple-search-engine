# The Simple Search Engine



## Introduction

Welcome to "The Simple Search Engine" â€“ our first project for the course "Artificial Intelligence and the Web." This project is a demonstration of integrating AI concepts with web technologies to create a basic search engine. Our aim is to provide a simplified but functional example of how search engines operate, leveraging artificial intelligence for data crawling and retrieval.
